# DKL3-Practice-Hack
A Speedrunning Practice Hack of the GB Donkey Kong Land 3 (JP GBC)

The level timer from time attack mode now runs during regular stages as well. This also makes it so that the time attack menu comes up when selecting a file even before having unlocked it (side effect of enabling time attack mode when selecting a file).
On top of that, game overing has been removed.
